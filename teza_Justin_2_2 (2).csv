UCA: Piloting Controller provides actuator movements during takeoff when the aircraft is not in a safe departure state. LossScenario: The data (e.g. aircraft manifest) provided to the piloting controller indicating the expected safe departure state of the aircraft was incompletely specified but is assumed by the piloting controller to be complete. The piloting controller therefore updates its process model of the desired safe departure state of the aircraft based on this wrong or incomplete information.\n,instruction: The flight operations system must confirm that data provided to it about the expected safe departure state of the aircraft has been fully specified.
UCA: Piloting Controller provides actuator movements during takeoff when the aircraft is not in a safe departure state. LossScenario: The update was not provided to the piloting controller due to poor communication.\n,instruction: The flight operations system must ensure that all relevant personnel are aware of any changes to the expected safe departure state of the aircraft.
UCA: Piloting Controller provides actuator movements during takeoff when the aircraft is not in a safe departure state. LossScenario: The data is missed or dropped before it can be processed by the piloting controller. This could occur because the piloting controller was preoccupied and unable to process the incoming data or the piloting controller was unaware of the arrival of the data to be processed.\n,instruction: The flight operations system must process all feedback to make a deliberate decision if it is to be ignored or dropped.
"UCA: Piloting Controller provides actuator movements during takeoff when the aircraft is not in a safe departure state.

"UCA: Piloting Controller provides actuator movements during takeoff when the aircraft is not in a safe departure state. LossScenario: For maintenance or configuration tasks, an update could have been made (or there was a delay in updating records) showing an outstanding task or issue after the piloting controller has checked the data collection mechanisms.

"UCA: Piloting controller provides actuator movements that pilots the aircraft toward another aircraft or object. LossScenario: If another aircraft or controller external to the aircraft providing airspace guidance is in contact with the aircraft and wrongly believes that the airspace nearby the aircraft is clear (for any of the same reasons above) or if a priori data indicates that no ground obstacles are present, the piloting controller may assume that the external controller or a priori data is providing accurate information and disregard the onboard sensors in favor of the guidance provided by the external controller. If the piloting controller is human, this may also contribute to confirmation bias, causing the piloting controller not to look for any other evidence that another aircraft or object is nearby. As a result, the piloting controller wrongly updates its process model of the airspace nearby the aircraft.\n",instruction: The flight operations system must receive all data required to determine the state of the environment and conditions around the aircraft under all Degraded Visual Environment conditions at all times.
"UCA: Piloting controller provides actuator movements that pilots the aircraft toward another aircraft or object. LossScenario: The piloting controller had the correct process model of the airspace at the point that it checked. However, between the time that the piloting controller checked the state of the airspace and the time that it begins its maneuver, an object or other aircraft enters the nearby airspace.

UCA: Piloting controller provides actuator movements that pilots the aircraft toward another aircraft or object.

"UCA: Piloting controller provides actuator movements that pilots the aircraft toward another aircraft or object. LossScenario: The feedback indicating the presence of another aircraft or object nearby was delayed in arriving.

UCA: Piloting controller provides actuator movements that pilots the aircraft toward another aircraft or object. LossScenario: Degraded Visual Environment conditions (e.g. wind gusts) move the aircraft toward the other aircraft or object with enough force or at a high enough rate that the piloting controller is unable to react quickly enough or with appropriate amplitude to correct the disturbance.\n,instruction: The flight operations system must be able to respond quickly enough and with an appropriate magnitude to disturbances to prevent unintended movements of the aircraft.
UCA: Piloting Controller does not provide actuator movements when violation of minimum separation is imminent.
