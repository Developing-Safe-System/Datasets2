Loss-scenario:  Changes in aircraft position are so slow or subtle that, especially under some Degraded Visual Environment conditions, the piloting controller is unable to distinguish the feedback showing the aircraft shifting or drifting in position. As a result, the mental model of the pilot  of the state or position of the aircraft does not match the actual state of the aircrafts or position.\n",Instruction: The flight operations system must be able to detect slow or subtle changes in the state of the aircraft under all Degraded Visual Environment conditions at all times.
"Unsafe-control-action: Piloting controller provides actuator movements that pilots the aircraft toward another aircraft or object. Loss-scenario: The feedback indicating the presence of another aircraft or object nearby was delayed in arriving. This might occur because Degraded Visual Environment conditions increase the processing time needed before the piloting controller receives the feedback. As a result, the piloting controller selects actuator movements based on its current process model of the airspace which does not reflect the presence of another aircraft or object.\n",Instruction: The flight operations system must select actuator movements that minimize the risk of violation of minimum separation when information about the state of the airspace is in a degraded condition (e.g. delayed).
"Unsafe-control-action: Piloting controller provides actuator movements that pilots the aircraft toward another aircraft or object. Loss-scenario: Feedback not showing the presence of another aircraft or object nearby was delayed in arriving. As a result, if the piloting controller is not aware of the delay, it might wrongly choose to incorporate that feedback even though it is already out of date.\n","Instruction: The flight operations system must be able to determine if any feedback it is receiving about the mission of the aircraft readiness, state of the aircraft and the airspace around it is too old."
Unsafe-control-action: Piloting controller provides actuator movements that pilots the aircraft toward another aircraft or object. Loss-scenario: Degraded Visual Environment conditions (e.g. wind gusts) move the aircraft toward the other aircraft or object with enough force or at a high enough rate that the piloting controller is unable to react quickly enough or with appropriate amplitude to correct the disturbance.\n,Instruction: The flight operations system must be able to respond quickly enough and with an appropriate magnitude to disturbances to prevent unintended movements of the aircraft.
Unsafe-control-action: Piloting Controller does not provide actuator movements when violation of minimum separation is imminent. Loss-scenario: The piloting controller is unable to select new actuator movements quickly enough to avoid violation of minimum separation. This might occur if the piloting controller recognizes the imminent violation too late or takes too long to select new actuator movements.\n,Instruction: The flight operations system must be able to respond quickly enough to avoid violations of minimum separation.
Unsafe-control-action: Piloting Controller does not provide actuator movements when violation of minimum separation is imminent. Loss-scenario: The Flight Operations System must ensure that a viable path is always available to avoid a violation of minimum separation.\n,Instruction: The flight operations system must ensure that a viable path is always available to avoid a violation of minimum separation.
Unsafe-control-action: Piloting Controller does not provide actuator movements when violation of minimum separation is imminent. Loss-scenario: The piloting controller has the wrong belief about the future movement of the other aircraft or object and believes that the other aircraft or object will no longer pose a threat.\n,Instruction: The flight operations system must receive all data required to determine the state of the environment and conditions around the aircraft under all Degraded Visual Environment conditions at all times.
Unsafe-control-action: Piloting Controller does not provide actuator movements when violation of minimum separation is imminent. Loss-scenario: A similar cybersecurity reason would apply here as well.\n,Instruction: The flight operations system must ensure that only authorized actuator movements are executed.
Unsafe-control-action: Piloting Controller does not provide actuator movements when violation of minimum separation is imminent. Loss-scenario: The piloting controller may have the wrong process model of the environment conditions and selects actuator movements that are insufficient to effect the desired change in flight path.\n,Instruction: The flight operations system must select actuator movements that are sufficient and appropriate to effect the desired change in flight path under the given environmental conditions.
Unsafe-control-action: Piloting Controller does not provide actuator movements when violation of minimum separation is imminent. Loss-scenario: The piloting controller selects actuator movements that avoid one violation of minimum separation but causes another one.\n,Instruction: The flight operations system must ensure that actuator movements avoid all possible violations of minimum separation.
