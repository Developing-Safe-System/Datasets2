"Unsafe control action: Piloting Controller provides actuator movements during takeoff when the aircraft is not in a safe departure state. LossScenario: Under the time constraints of needing to depart for a mission, the piloting controller either decides to or is told by another controller to expedite departure checks. This could be the result of unsafe operational adaptation to speed up the time required to prepare the aircraft for departure or the result of a capability to override or otherwise influence the checks. As a result, the piloting controller does not perform a complete update of its process model of the state of the aircraft and therefore might believe that, based on what it did check, the aircraft is in a safe departure state.\n",instruction: The flight operations system must confirm that all aspects of the aircraft state match the safe departure state prior to departure.
